### 1. Configuration System
- Created a YAML configuration file for centralized management of all hyperparameters
- All aspects of the training pipeline are now configurable (data, model, training, callbacks)
- Command-line support for specifying different config files
- Automatic saving of configuration with each run for reproducibility

### 2. TensorBoard Integration
- Real-time visualization of training metrics (loss, accuracy, learning rate)
- Model architecture visualization
- Periodic prediction vs. actual plots
- Performance analysis across different runs
- Training progress tracking with early stopping visualization

### 3. Run Management
- Each training run gets a unique timestamp identifier
- Organized directory structure for checkpoints, logs, and plots
- Comprehensive logging of all training metrics
- Automatic saving of checkpoints at regular intervals

### 4. Enhanced Training Features
- Support for multiple optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW)
- Multiple learning rate schedulers (plateau, step, cosine)
- Improved early stopping with configurable parameters
- Runtime performance tracking

## How to Use:

1. **Setup Configuration**:
   - Edit `config.yaml` to customize your training setup
   - All paths, hyperparameters, and training options are defined here

2. **Run Training**:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
   Or specify a different config file:
   ```
   python train_model.py --config alternative_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor with TensorBoard**:
   ```
   tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard_logs
   ```
   This will provide real-time visualizations of:
   - Training/validation loss curves
   - RÂ² performance metrics
   - Learning rate changes
   - Model predictions
   - Network architecture

4. **Review Results**:
   - Each run creates a timestamped folder with complete records
   - Best model is automatically saved
   - Training history plots are generated
   - Performance metrics are stored in JSON format
